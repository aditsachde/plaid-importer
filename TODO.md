- [ ] Fetch historical transactions and put them in a database â€” No need for webhook support
- [ ] Fetch account data and put them in a database
- [ ] Fetch item data and put them in a database - for when there are multiple items
- [ ] Duplicate authenticateAccount to support updating credentials 
- [ ] Way to set webhooks - Probably through config file
- [ ] Expand config file to include all config, not just a single set of credentials
- [ ] Add support for multiple items via a yaml array, not via item database
- [ ] Handle DEFAULT_UPDATE webhook
- [ ] Handle TRANSACTION_REMOVED webhook
- [ ] Verify JWT

- Webhooks are probably best served via FastAPI
- Abstract the fetch transactions and deduplication logic into a function/file, it'll be needed for cronjobs and called from webhooks
- Config file should include webhook url, api keys and environment, and array for items
